                                ~~~~~~~~~~

== Introduction

This is a trivial wrapper around libc's glob(3) function for OCaml. The Glob
module interface contains a single function, glob. This function takes a
string argument possibly containing shell wildcards, and returns an array
containing the names of the file system entries matching it.

== Installation

To build the bytecode library:

  $ make

To build the native code library:

  $ make opt

You can build both in a single step with

  $ make reallyall

To install, type

  # make install
