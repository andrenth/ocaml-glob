                                ~~~~~~~~~~

This is a trivial wrapper around libc's glob(3) function for OCaml. The Glob
module interface contains a single function, glob. This function takes a
string argument possibly containing shell wildcards, and returns an array
containing the names of the file system entries matching it.
